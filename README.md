# Tableau Public Visualisation
## Background

In this section we go over some of the visualizations I've created by participating in **Makeover Monday**. These
are both weekly challenges where participants construct compelling stories of data utilizing technologies such as Tableau, etc...
I participated in these challenges to better understand how to communicate data to others

### [Makeover Monday](https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/)

> **Makeover Monday** is your weekly learning and development appointment with yourself and hundreds of passionate data people. For free!
> Join us every Monday to work with a given data set and create better, more effective visualizations and help us make information more accessible. The Makeover Monday community comes together every week from around the globe and we would love for YOU to become part of it, too.

## Examples
Below is some of my work and comparisons against the original visualizations.
